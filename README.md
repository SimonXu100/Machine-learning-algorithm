# Machine-learning-algorithm
Machine learning algorithms(Matlab or Octave)
Main content:
Supervised Learning
- Linear regression, Logistic regression, neural networks, SVMs

Unsupervised Learning
- K-means, PCA, Anomaly detection

Special applications/special topics 
- Recommder systems, large scale machine learning

Advice on building a machine learning system
- Bias/variance, regularization; deciding what to work on next:evaluation of learning algorithms, learning curves,error analysis, ceiling analysis
